/**
 * @title GaslessFactory
 * @author Fireblocks
 * @notice A factory contract that deploys contracts and executes functions on them.
 *
 * This contract serves as a factory designed to deploy contracts and execute post deployment functions on the deployed
 * contract. This unopinionated factory is capable of deploying any arbitrary bytecode and execute corresponding
 * post-deployment functions. This factory allows the deployment of contracts using the provided bytecode and inputs.
 *
 * @dev This factory contract supports both normal and deterministic deployments of contracts. The deployment process
 * accepts the contract bytecode and inputs, allowing for flexibility in creating various types of contracts.
 *
 * If a `postConfig` is provided, it is treated as a single unit of post-deployment configuration. The entire set of
 * `postConfig` must execute successfully; otherwise, the deployment will be considered a failure, and the contract
 * will not be deployed.
 *
 * This factory contract also offers the ability to deploy contracts deterministically using the `create2` opcode when
 * desired. This allows pre-computation of contract addresses. In cases where a set of `postConfig` exists, it is
 * executed immediately after deployment, and if any part of the `postConfig` instructions fail, the entire deployment
 * is reverted to maintain atomicity.
