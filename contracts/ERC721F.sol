/**
 * @title ERC721F
 * @author Fireblocks
 * @notice This contract represents a non-fungible token within the Fireblocks ecosystem of contracts.
 *
 * The contract utilizes the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) for seamless upgradability. This standard
 * enables the contract to be easily upgraded without disrupting its state. By following the UUPS proxy pattern, the
 * ERC721F logic is separated from the storage, allowing upgrades while preserving the existing data. This
 * approach ensures that the contract can adapt and evolve over time, incorporating improvements and new features and
 * mitigating potential attack vectors in future.
 *
 * The ERC721F contract Role Based Access Control employs following roles:
 *
 *  - UPGRADER_ROLE
 *  - PAUSER_ROLE
 *  - CONTRACT_ADMIN_ROLE
 *  - MINTER_ROLE
 *  - BURNER_ROLE
 *  - RECOVERY_ROLE
 *  - SALVAGE_ROLE
 *
 * The ERC721F Token contract can utilize an Access Registry contract to retrieve information on whether an account
 * is authorized to interact with the system.
